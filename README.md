    Ran Wang, Xinlei Zhou, Meng Hu, Wenhui Wu, Yuheng Jia
    2024.

## Requisite

This code is implemented in PyTorch, and we have tested the code under the following environment settings:

- python = 3.9.12
- torch = 1.8.1
- torchvision = 0.9.1

## What is in this repository
 - Codes for our feature statistics with uncertainty module in standard training (FSU-ST) and the FSU with fine-tuning strategy in advertral training (FSU-FiT) (Will be relased when the manuscript is accpted)
   
 - Well-trained models for CIFAR10 are shown in the following links:
